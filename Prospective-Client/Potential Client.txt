    Which companies in your area are purchasing group benefits plans for their employees
    What types of plans are they purchasing (medical, dental, life, etc.)
    What insurance carriers/providers are they currently using
    Who are the primary contacts within the company (CEO, HR, plan admin) and what are their phone and email addresses
    When are the renewal dates for each plan
    Who are you competing against (current BOR)
    How many employees are participating in each plan
    And how much commission can you expect to make when you win the business


There are 2 types of Form 5500 filings -- welfare benefits (company with 120+ employees) and retirement filings (any size company). One of the best ways to identify and target smaller company leads, under 100 employees, is to be able to search for companies that have filed the 'Retirement' Form 5500. It tends to reason, if a company is offering their employees a retirement plan, like a 401(k), the chances are very good that they are also offering group benefits like health, life or dental to those same folks.



Insurance brokers, agents, and consultants gain more information to better conduct prospecting. For example, having a companyâ€™s complete welfare employee benefit plan gives them an edge to identify renewal dates, plan types, insurance carriers, and existing broker relationships.

Insurance carriers use this data to find new sales opportunities by identifying broker relationships and helping grow their books of business.

can find all those businesses that truly need, want and already buy the products and services you are selling.

Now it is time to enrich and enhance the company information. We leverage machine learning and primary sources of information (like the company's website) to extract additional company details. We enhance the data by adding a company description, type of industry, specialties, website address information and more.

the beginning of the plan year), 
you may be eligible to file the
